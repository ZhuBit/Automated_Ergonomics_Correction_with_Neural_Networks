# Automated Ergonomics Correction with Neural Networks

Welcome to the repository for the project "Automated Ergonomics Correction with Neural Networks." This project explores the application of neural networks to enhance ergonomic practices, providing automated solutions to posture correction and ergonomic assessments.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find the source code, scripts, and documentation associated with the project. The key objectives of this project are:

- **Ergonomics Analysis**: Leveraging neural networks to assess and optimize ergonomic practices.
- **Automated Posture Correction**: Implementing algorithms that suggest real-time corrections to improve posture.
- **Data Visualization**: Tools and techniques to visualize ergonomic data and outcomes.

## Thesis

The full documentation of this project, including the theoretical background, methodology, experiments, and results, is detailed in the thesis.
